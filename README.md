## üì• Loading the Data

Rather than loading the data directly into Power BI, I chose to connect it through an SQL Server. This setup allows all visualizations to update dynamically whenever new data is added to the source

For this project, I used pgAdmin4 to manage and query the database efficiently.

- Once the database was set up in pgAdmin4 I created a table with the same columns as the source CSVs‚Äîone.

```SQL
-- Create Table "coffee_sales"
CREATE TABLE coffee_sales(
	transaction_id INT,
	transaction_date DATE,
	transaction_time TIME,
	transaction_qty INT,
	store_id INT,
	store_location VARCHAR(100),
	product_id INT,
	unit_price FLOAT,
	product_category VARCHAR(100),
	product_type VARCHAR(100),
	product_detail VARCHAR(100)
);
```
- Next, I imported all the raw data from the source CSV files into the newly created table using pgAdmin4 Import Data wizard.
- Each column was thoroughly reviewed to gain a clear understanding of the data and its relevance within the business domain. No missing values or inconsistencies were identified.
- `üìÑNote`: For better readability, only key snippets are shown in this README. You can view the full set of SQL queries <a href="/queries.sql">**in this file**</a>

## üîå Connecting SQL Server Database to Power BI
Linking SQL Server Management Studio database directly to Power BI in order to easily visualize and analyze the data in real-time.

Before creating visualization, using DAX time intelligence functionality, I created additional table, calculated columns and measures, incorporating key business metrics and performance indicators to strengthen dashboard insights. New Added Table, Coumns and Measures are following:

- Date Table
- MONTH, Month Number, Month Year, Day Name, Week Number, Day Number, Week Day Number 
- Weekday / Weekend
- Hour
- Total Orders
- Total Quantity Sold
- Total Sales
- Current Month Orders
- Current Month Quantity
- Current Month Sales
- Previous Month Orders
- Previous Month Quantity
- Previous Month Sales
- MOM Change Orders
- MOM Change Quantity
- MOM Change Sales 
- Label for Product Category
- Label for Product Type
- Label for Store Location

## üìà Dashboard Development

The dashboard....

**Coffee Sales Dashboard** 

<img width="1584" height="396" alt="connect" src="/images/dashboard.jpg" />

- **KPIs** : There are 3 main KPIs -> Total Sales, Total Orders and Total Quantity Sold.
- **Filters** : Dashboard can be filtered by Month, Date, Weekdays or Weekends, Category, Product Types
- **Slicer**: I used month as a slicer, only one month can be selected at a time.
